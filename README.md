# MMM-Todoist-Filters
This an extension for the [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror), based largely on the "MMM-Todoist" module by cbrooker.  It can display your Todoist todos, organized into groups defined by filters of project, label, due date, etc. Only one account supported.
The requests to the server will be paused is the module is not displayed (use of a carousel or hidden by Remote-Control for example) or by the use of a PIR sensor and the module MMM-PIR-Sensor. An immediate update will occurs at the return of the module display.

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/pharmot/MMM-Todoist-Filters.git`. A new folder will appear navigate into it.
2. Execute `npm install` to install the node dependencies.
